# Anti Idle

This is a small utility that prevents your Windows PC from going idle, turning off the display or entering sleep.

## Usage

Anti Idle can be run as an [AutoHotkey](https://www.autohotkey.com/) script, or by using the [standalone executable](https://github.com/mihaifm/antiidle/releases/latest/download/antiidle.exe) in the Releases.

There are 3 methods of preventing the system from going idle. Choose any or all 3, depending on your needs:

- **Keep display active** - this should work in most cases, it just tells Windows that the Anti Idle app needs the display
- **Move mouse** - this moves the mouse up and down by one pixel at periodic intervals
- **Press modifier keys** - this presses the Shift and Ctrl keys at periodic intervals. Useful in certain games that detect AFK (away from keyboard) players

Enjoy!
